# Anno4c - Production calculator for Anno 1404

## Installing

You don't really need to install anything, just Python 3.x with Tk/Tcl.
In the directory in which the anno4c.py file is localed, create a directory called
`imgs` and add png files for all the main wares which are consumed by the population.
(The files should be all lower case). Look at the program source to find which files
need to be included. The program is written for 46x46 pixel images.
